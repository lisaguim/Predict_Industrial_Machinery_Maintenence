<h2 align="center"> Predict Industrial Machinery Maintenence </h1>

### ðŸ“Œ Project description and methodology

The goal of this project is to develop a supervised learning binary classification algorithm to predict when maintenance is required or not on an industrial machine.

The methodology of this project consists of the steps of data exploration and cleaning, data preprocessing, modeling, model evaluation and optimization.

### ðŸ“œ Dataset

The dataset used contains fictitious data from the recording of 178 IoT (Internet of Things) sensor data readings.

Each row of the dataset contains 178 readings, which are the columns of different sensors. In other words, there are 178 columns that make up the IoT sensor readings. In total, there are 11,500 rows and 179 columns, with the last column (179th) containing the status of the industrial machine, whether or not it required maintenance, i.e., it is the target variable.

### ðŸ“š Libraries

Python libraries used for this project are:

- pickle
- sklearn
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- xgboost
- spicy  

### Explory Analysis and Data Cleanning

### Pre-Processing

1- Data Division at trainning, validation and test
2 - Class balancing (trainning subset)
3 - Standardization

### Data Modeling Predictive

1- Metrics
2 - Creating models:

Logistic Regression
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Decision Tree and Boosting

### Cross Validation

### Hypermarameter Optimization

GridSerachCV

### ðŸ“Š Results

Based on the analysis of the data, we have no statistical evidence to state that geographic region has an influence on the average conversion rate in the data analyzed.
