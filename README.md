### ðŸ“Œ Project description and methodology

This project aims to verify whether or not geolocation interfers with conversion rates (the sale of the product) though statistical test.

This analysis is applicable, for example when a company carries out a Digital Marketing campaign in different geographic areas.

During the project, it was verified which statistical test (parametric or non-parametric) is the most appropriate for the distribution of the data.

### ðŸ“œ Dataset

The dataset used has random and fictitious data, which consists of 5 columns. 



### ðŸ“š Libraries

Python libraries used for this project are:

- pickle
- sklearn
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- xgboost
- spicy  

### Explory Analysis and Data Cleanning

### Pre-Processing

1- Data Division at trainning, validation and test
2- Class balancing (trainning subset)
3 - Standardization

### Data Modeling Predictive

1- Metrics
2 - Creating models:

Logistic Regression
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Decision Tree and Boosting

### Cross Validation

### Hypermarameter Optimization

GridSerachCV

### ðŸ“Š Results

Based on the analysis of the data, we have no statistical evidence to state that geographic region has an influence on the average conversion rate in the data analyzed.
